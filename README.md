## üìò Overview

This repository contains PDF reports for each **Microprocessor (MPL)** practical implemented using **NASM (Netwide Assembler)** on x86 architecture.  
Each PDF is a self-contained experiment record that includes:

- **Aim / Objective** ‚Äî purpose of the experiment.  
- **Apparatus / Tools** ‚Äî assembler/simulator setup used (NASM + DOSBox/EMU8086).  
- **Algorithm / Flowchart** ‚Äî stepwise logic and execution flow.  
- **Assembly Code (NASM)** ‚Äî complete, well-commented source listing.  
- **Output / Result** ‚Äî screenshots or terminal outputs showing the working result.  
- **Observations / Conclusion** ‚Äî remarks on instruction behavior, carry/overflow handling, and limitations.

Each practical is provided in a **separate PDF file**, so you can view, download, or reference any experiment easily and individually.
