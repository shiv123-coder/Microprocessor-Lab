## üìò Overview

This repository contains PDF reports for each Microprocessor practical.  
Each PDF is a self-contained experiment record that includes:

- **Aim / Objective** ‚Äî what the experiment does.  
- **Apparatus / Tools** ‚Äî simulators/assemblers used.  
- **Algorithm / Flowchart** ‚Äî logical steps to solve the problem.  
- **Assembly Code** ‚Äî complete source listing (8085 / 8086 as applicable).  
- **Output / Result** ‚Äî screenshots or sample outputs demonstrating the program behavior.  
- **Observations / Conclusion** ‚Äî short notes on behavior, edge cases, timings, etc.

The PDFs are intentionally separated ‚Äî one file per practical ‚Äî so you can read, download, or reference a single experiment quickly.

## üîç Example: What you‚Äôll find inside each PDF

**(Example contents for `01_Input_Display_64bit.pdf`)**
1. **Title & Aim** ‚Äî Input and display of 64-bit hexadecimal numbers.  
2. **Tools** ‚Äî 8086/8085 simulator, TASM/MASM, DOSBox (if applicable).  
3. **Algorithm / Flowchart** ‚Äî stepwise plan (how bytes are read/printed).  
4. **Assembly Source** ‚Äî complete commented source listing.  
5. **Test Inputs** ‚Äî sample hex values used for testing.  
6. **Output Screenshots** ‚Äî simulator console or memory dump showing the result.  
7. **Observations** ‚Äî remarks on carry, sign, formatting, limitations.  

This same structure is followed for all PDFs so you can understand the objective, the exact code, and verify the output quickly.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Recommended Setup (for reproducibility)

- Intel 8085 / 8086 simulators (example: GNUSim8085, EMU8086)  
- MASM / TASM (if code is MASM/TASM-specific)  
- DOSBox (for older assembler environments)  
- A screenshot tool to capture outputs (for future practicals)

## ü§ù Contribution & Notes

- If you want to add or correct a PDF, open an issue or create a pull request with the updated file.  
- Naming convention for new practicals: `NN_Short_Title.pdf` where `NN` is the two-digit serial number.  
- Keep the internal structure (Aim, Algorithm, Code, Output, Observations) for consistency.
